                    <p class="text-base lg:text-xl">John Riad is an interesting guy. He is the oldest of two brothers born to Egyptian parents in Denmark.</p>

            <div class="text-base lg:px-6 mt-4">
                <p class="mb-4">In the early 2000s, John Riad founded the firm in response to the lack of a standardized online real estate site.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">John is the oldest of two brothers born to Egyptian parents in Denmark. He spent his youth in Copenhagen, where he also took his business degree. Eventually, his studies led him to an internship in Manila. He fell in love with the city.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">John realized that the Philippines was sorely lacking an online brokerage that simplified the sale and purchase of Real Estate. In 2003, a small investment and big dreams led to the creation of HousingInteractive, the first online brokerage in the country.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Nowadays, bigger name brands come to mind — but HousingInteractive stands out as the brokerage that opened the door for these new players.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">HousingInteractive started the trend that ushered in a way of life.</p>

                        <p>This distinction was clear to multinational giants, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which signed on as a major client of HousingInteractive. We started catering to the distinct home needs of the busy ADB executives.</p>
